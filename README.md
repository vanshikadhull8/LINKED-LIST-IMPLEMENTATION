we build a Linked List program in C it's almost like organizing a chain of people holding hands. Each person knows who is next in line, and that’s how the data is connected. A linked list is a collection of nodes, and each node contains two parts: the actual data (like a person’s name) and a pointer to the next node (like the hand reaching out to the next person). We usually start with a pointer called head which tells us where the list begins. Now, when we want to insert a new node, we decide where — at the beginning, at the end, or somewhere in between. If it’s at the beginning, we simply create a new node, point its “next” to the current head, and then update head to this new node. If at the end, we walk (traverse) through the list until we reach the last node, and make its “next” point to our new node.

Deletion works in the same human sense. Imagine you want to remove a person from the chain. You don’t need to break the entire chain; you just redirect the hand of the person before them to the next person. So, in code, we find the node to delete and change the next pointer of the previous node

Traversal is like reading the entire guest list — you start at the head and move node by node, printing or using the data. It’s simple but essential for viewing or working with the data in the list
